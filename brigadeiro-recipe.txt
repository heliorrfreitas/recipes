Ingredients:
    - 1 can sweetened condensed milk 14-ounce
    - 1/4 cup baking cocoa powder
    - 2 tablespoon unsalted butter (softened) plus extra to grease plate and hands
    - 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
    - Chocolate vermicelli or good quality chocolate sprinkles


Directions:
1.Whisk the condensed milk and cocoa powder together until obtaining a homogeneous mixture (without lumps of cocoa powder). Then, stir in the butter.
2. Stove: Cook in a medium non-stick saucepan over medium-low to medium heat (large burner), stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and starts to peel away or show the bottom of the pan when you scrape it with your wood spoon (about 5-8 minutes). The chocolate fudge mixture should be thick enough to show you the bottom of the pan for a couple of seconds before the mixture levels out again.

3.Microwave: Pour mixture into a deep microwaveable bowl. If 900 watts, let cook on full power for about 6 minutes -- removing and stirring at least every 2 minutes, or until thick enough to be rolled (remember that when it cools down, mixture will be thicker). While it is cooking, do not leave the microwave unattended because mixture will rise and possibly bubble over, making a mess. Every time it rises, pause until mixture settles back down. If 1100 watts, cook at 80 % power. Double batches take more time to cook.
4.When chocolate fudge is ready, remove either from the stove top or microwave, mix in the vanilla extract and spread mixture onto a greased plate.

5.Let cool to room temperature before starting to roll them into balls with greased hands. Use a 1/2 ( or 1 ) Tablespoon as measurement. Then, dredge gently in the chocolate vermicellis until totally covered, and place into paper bonbon cups.
